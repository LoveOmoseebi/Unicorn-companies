# Unicorn Companies (SQL)

This project is about private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. 
This data was analysed using SQL(postgresql).

The analysis on the data was used to answer questions such as:
1. Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
2. How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?
3. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?
4. Many more questions.
